# COURSE-MANAGAMENT-SYSTEM
The Course Management System is designed to manage courses, students, and instructors in a university setting. It allows administrators to create courses, add students, assign instructors, and manage enrollments.

The project is structured into different modules:

Course Module: Manages course details such as name, code, and credits.
Student Module: Manages student information and their course enrollments.
Instructor Module: Manages instructor assignments to courses.
Enrollment Module: Handles student enrollment into courses and tracks progress.
